            <p className="about-me-phrase">Iâ€™m a Computer Science student passionate about exploring the intersection of IoT, embedded systems, and full-stack development. I enjoy creating solutions that connect hardware and software, from building smart cooling systems and LED scoreboards to developing interactive web applications like e-commerce platforms and typing games. With skills in Python, React, FastAPI, and embedded hardware (Arduino/ESP32), I focus on turning ideas into real, practical solutions that make life smarter, simpler, and more connected.</p>
